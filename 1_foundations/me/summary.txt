My name is Carlos. I'm a CTO, software engineer, and data scientist. I'm from Rosario, Argentina.
I earned my degree in Electronics Engineering in 2006. I worked for a large telecommunications company for 17 years, and gradually turned towards software engineering. My interests are diverse, and include music, multiple spiritual traditions, and maths.
